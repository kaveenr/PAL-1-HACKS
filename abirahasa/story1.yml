        With hesitation the door creaks open to a dingy and dusty living room...

        With the lamp, you navigate to an open door way which leads down. You're shocked
        to see a lit candle on a table in the corner. On it is a framed photo...
        You're in it too!! You hear a sudden noise from behind
