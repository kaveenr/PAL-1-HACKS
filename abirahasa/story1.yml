        You're at the side of an empty road, north of you is a foot path...
        There is a sign that says 'Welcome To Abirahasa' next to the path.

        You walk along, to find a clearing with an old house, it looks uninhabited.
        Shaking the door knob reveal that it's locked. Off to the left is an garage.

        You walk into the garage to see an old Volkswagen Karmann Ghia covered in dust.
        At the back is a bench with broken car parts.
        You go closer to see a jar full of bolts... Shining in it is a key!

        With hesitation the door creaks open to a dingy and dusty living room...
        It's much bigger space that anticipated, ahead is darkness.
        There seems to be a kitchen area to the right

        You break the cobwebs and navigate to the kitchen, there is a book on the table
        the cover seems familiar to you. Next to it is a lamp.
    west: home
    pickup: lamp

        With the lamp, you navigate to an open door way which leads down. The basement
        is mostly empty. In the corner you see an desk with a computer, there is power!
        
        After flicking the switch, it prompts 'Please Insert Boot Disk'. Drive B has a disc
        but the Drive A is empty.
        
        Strangley, you hear noise and music from the living room.

            The computer is blocking your path, The display reads,
            'Please Insert Boot Disk'

        You run back up with confusion to a bright light, eyes closed you stride into
        the living room to see that it's not the same. There are people partying, the
        Hi-Fi is blasting music, you can't make out what's playing.
        
        Light headed, you sit down on the chair. You look towards the kitchen 
        to see yourself reading!
        
        You look down and on the coffee table is a disk with the label 'CPM 2.2'

            You try to walk into the kitchen, but your head starts hurting. You fall
            back to the chair.
    pickup: disc

        You insert the disc into drive A of the computer. And the computer without
        effort boots into CPM.
        
        You navigate to the second drive and find a file called README, it reads,
        
        Hey there, Welcome home!
        You're not feeling that well, sometimes you forget where you are.
        ###@###__
        
        The disk drive makes a loud screeching noise and the computer hangs up.
        Your head hurts.. You hear rumbling of an engine from the living room
